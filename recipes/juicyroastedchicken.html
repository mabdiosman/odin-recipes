      <p>
        This roasted chicken is perfectly seasoned and just like the way my
        grandmother used to make it. The method used in this recipe results in
        the juiciest chicken! We loved to nibble on the celery after it was
        cooked.

      <h2>Roasted Chicken Ingredients</h2>
      <p>
        These are the ingredients you'll need to make the juiciest roast chicken
        recipe of your life:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Chicken</strong>: This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole
          chicken. If your bird is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the
          recipe.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Seasonings</strong>: This roasted chicken is simply seasoned
          with salt, black pepper, and onion powder.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Butter</strong>: Butter locks in moisture and gives the
          seasonings something to adhere to.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Celery</strong>: Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for
          subtle vegetal flavor. Plus, the celery will release even more
          moisture as the chicken cooks
        </li>
      </ul>
